  "name": "L'AVENUES",
"bio": "L'AVENUES aren’t just a band — they’re Solihull’s Premier Existential Garage Collective: three blokes turning bus-stop silence, receipt paper and car-park reverb into grit-pop anthems. Built on cheap cables, loud truths and the sanctity of the meal deal, their sound is equal parts concrete melancholy and fluorescent catharsis — anti-corporate, pro-pensioner, forever one chorus away from a minor system crash.",
